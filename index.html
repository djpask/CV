  <p><em> Information <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com"> <strong>technology</strong></a> professional</em></p>
  <p> In this particular file I'm writing down some text as an exercise, as I'm respawning my html knowledge.
    The objective here is to fill the gap and jump to javascript learning and try to write a prototype hyperledger fabric app,
    using angular or other javascript frameworks. As this is a free-time goal, I'm taking it a bit easy and starting from the beginning,
    also because I'd like to learn to use Atom. This is a gently approach as I haven't do programming for many years. Indeed,
    although I have a strong technical background, my principal knowledge is on computer networks and operating systems. I also have, developed software in the past,
    expecially in Java. But, anyway, at the time I was programming, javascript was only a front-end scripting language. Nowadays, It has developer as a full-stack language,
    making it a very interesting programming solution.<br>
    I'm also writing in english as another userful exercise, but actually I'm Italian. <br>
    I'm really üíô this course till now.</p>
